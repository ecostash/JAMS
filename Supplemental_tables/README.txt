Descriptions for supplemental tables S1 to S7
S1. Values for ecological response variables in Figure 2a - c (left column), Figure 3 a, and Figure 4b expressed at the per unit area (m2 or m1 stream bank) within five mountain streams in the Colorado Front Range, USA. 
S2. Values for ecological response variables in Figure 2d – f (righ column), Figure 3b, Figure 4a, c expressed at the per unit stream valley or stream bank (m1 valley or m1 stream bank) scales within five mountain streams in the Colorado Front Range, USA. 
S3. Mean and 95% confidence intervals for the habitat specific ecological response variables used in Figure 2a – c (left column), Figure 3a, Figure 4b expressed at the per unit area (m2 or m1 stream bank) within five mountain streams in the Colorado Front Range, USA.
S4. Mean and 95% confidence intervals of taxa biomass within pool, riffle, and wood habitats in five mountain streams in the Colorado Front Range, USA.
