This repository contains the example data sets, R code, and stepwise descriptions of the secondary production and bootstrapping procedures used in the following manuscript:

  Venarsky MP, Walters DM, Hall RO, Livers B, Wohl E. In review. Shifting stream planform state decreases stream productivity yet  
  increases riparian animal production

Email questions, comments, and ideas on how to improve either the analysis itself or the methodological description to Michael Venarsky (mvenarsky@gmail.com). Meaningful contributions will be credited to the person.
